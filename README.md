**Important:** This is a new branch for Chromatics 3.x series. It is a complete rebuild of Chromatics from the ground up.

It will utilise the new version of Sharlayan for async FFXIV calls and RGB.NET to standardise RGB device SDK's (as opposed to manually managing them as Chromatics 2.x did)

Chromatics 3.x is built in .NET 6.


**Open Source Libraries**
* [RGB.NET](https://github.com/DarthAffe/RGB.NET) - used for RGB device integration
* [Sharlayan](https://github.com/FFXIVAPP/sharlayan) - used for FFXIV memory reading
